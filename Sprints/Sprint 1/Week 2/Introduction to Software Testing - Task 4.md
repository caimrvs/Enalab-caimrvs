# Introduction to Software Testing

### Why we shouldn't test everything manually?

There are many reasons why we do not test everything manually.
Manual tests take a lot of time and cost a lot of money.
Because people do the tests, mistakes can happen.
Manual tests are also hard to repeat.

Automated tests are different.
They are faster and easier to repeat.
We can run automated tests many times when needed.
