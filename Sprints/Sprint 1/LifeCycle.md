# The LifeCycle 

 I'm studied the Software Development LifeCycle (SDLC) material at day 1, monday. 
 The SDLC is a development planning for the projects, with must importance for the projects organization Passing the next stages: Planning, Analysis, Design, Implementation, Testing, Maintenance. I created one SDLC diagram on the Excalidraw plataform.
