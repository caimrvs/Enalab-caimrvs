### ✅ Day 2

I finished Week 1 by completing the final tasks: User Stories and Criteria.
On that day, I worked on the User Stories content, watching the classes, and I believe I understood the content quite well. I created my User Stories based on the Enalab project.
I also worked on the DoD, DoS, and acceptance criteria, where I understood much more than I did with the User Stories.

Here are the links to my Markdown archives.
