### Day 2

I finished Week 1 by completing the final tasks: User Stories and Criteria.
On that day, I worked on the User Stories content, watching the classes, and I believe I understood the content quite well. I created my User Stories based on the Enalab project.
I also worked on the DoD, DoS, and acceptance criteria, where I understood much more than I did with the User Stories.

Here are the links to my Markdown archives.

### Day 3

I continued studying User Stories and Criteria, even after finishing the tasks.
I organized part of my repository.

### Day 4 

I started studying the HTTP and HTTPS protocols. I understood a lot and I believe I learned how most of the client and server relationship works, using the API as a way to communicate.
On the same day, I also started studying JSON. I watched some videos that helped me understand the topic. I believe I understood the JSON documentation better than the HTTP protocols.

### Day 5

It was a very busy day. I delivered the JSON task early in the afternoon.
I continued studying other things during the day and night. I worked on video lessons about software testing and test cases, and I completed the test case task.
To complement the video content, I also watched two more videos.
